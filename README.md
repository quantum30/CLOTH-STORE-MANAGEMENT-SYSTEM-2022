# CLOTH-STORE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-2022

The Cloth Store Management System is a simple MySQL project that aims to 
help a small-scale clothing or apparel business/shop to manage its sales through a
simple online portal. 

It gives a clear picture of the suppliers of different types of clothes and strictly 
evaluates the bill per customer. The admin can easily view the transactions and 
dealings through the dynamically designed database. The customers enjoy the 
facility of being able to order the cloth of their choice from a vast collection of 
apparels at a glance.

any clothing store present in any locality.

kind of frauds whatsoever. 
- Users get the benefit to shop online right from the comfort of their home.
